# Sownik

Simple dictionary app created in Kivy.
It is entirely open source, you can do with it whatever and whenever you want.

You'll need any device that's capable of running Python stuff

#Windows:
Install those:
- Python 2.7
- Kivy 1.9.1

and run main.py!

#Android:
- Download and instal Kivy Launcher: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kivy.pygame&hl=pl 
- Create "Kivy" folder in your device's storage root catalog
- copy files to /Kivy/App_name
- make sure there is an "android.txt" file inside
- run Kivy Launcher and launch the app!

There are files suggesting gestures compatibility but they're not working ATM, please ignore them, but DON'T delete them otherwise the app may crash.

Enjoy!
